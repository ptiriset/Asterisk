# 🚉 RExCL - Railway Exchange Configuration Language Tool

**RExCL** is a Python-based utility designed for Indian Railways (IR) to simplify the deployment and management of open-source VoIP exchanges. It automates the modification of core Asterisk configuration files using simple, predefined codes tailored for railway communication needs.

## 📖 Overview
The Railway Board has adopted open-source **Asterisk** for Inter-Railway communication. RExCL acts as an automation layer that allows telecom engineers to:
* 🛠️ **Automate Accounts**: Quickly create and manage user accounts.
* 📞 **Configure Dialplans**: Generate IR-compliant dialplans without manual file editing.
* ⚡ **Standardize Configs**: Ensure uniform configuration across different railway exchanges using predefined codes.

## 🚀 Key Features
* **Automated File Modification**: Modifies `sip.conf` and `extensions.conf` automatically.
* **Railway-Specific Logic**: Built-in templates for Inter-Railway numbering and communication standards.
* **Simplified Interface**: No deep knowledge of Asterisk scripting required for basic exchange setup.

## 🛠️ Installation
*Coming Soon* — Instructions for setting up the Python environment and dependencies will be added here.

## 💻 Usage
The tool uses predefined codes to configure railway exchanges . 
*(Specific command examples will be added as development progresses)*.
